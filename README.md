👋 Hello there! I'm Sohaib Zafar, a passionate web developer and designer from Pakistan 🇵🇰.

🚀 As a BS Computer Science student, I've spent years honing my skills in the world of web development. My journey began with the basics and has since evolved into a strong proficiency in an array of technologies. From crafting beautiful user interfaces with React.js and designing captivating user experiences with Adobe UX/UI, to building robust backends using MERN stack, PHP, and Python, I'm always excited to embark on new challenges.

🌱 Currently, I'm exploring advanced techniques in frontend development and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with modern web technologies. I'm open to collaborating on projects that not only stretch my abilities but also contribute positively to the tech community.

💡 Outside of coding, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through tutorials and technical blog posts. I believe in the power of learning and sharing, and I'm dedicated to helping fellow developers grow.
